## 🛠️ Projects

Here are some of my key projects 

### 1. **Project 1: KafkAI**
   - **Description:** In this project I decided to generate a missing part of Franz Kafka’s novels. I created scripts for using different LLM models. Then I fine-tuned Meta Llama3 and Gemini models to optimize the results. I hosted scripts and models using Google Cloud including Compute Engine and VertexAI. 
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Google Cloud Service
   - **Link:** [Project Repository](https://github.com/wrmorawski/kafkai)

### 2. **Project 2: Missing Values tools**
   - **Description:** a python package for data imputation that allows for joint simple methods and complex techniques (like KNN) within one function. I decided to create this package due to the lack of  similar solution in other libraries. 
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pytest, Pre-commit
   - **Link:** [Project Repository](https://github.com/wrmorawski/mvtools)
